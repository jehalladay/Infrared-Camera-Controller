
Alex Antoun: Researching and implementing I2C Protocols+wiring so that the spectrometer, and Infrared camera devices can be integrated. Additionally wrote software to
    collect data from the mega-pixel wide angle camera. Wrote code (with testing) that is executed by other code to collect data. Tested integration with hardware 
    and load balancing CPU.
    
James Halladay: Wrote software that implements hardware drivers based on the statemachine given in the presentation, entire back-end implementation of accessing and 
    storing data, responsible for converting numeric data into human readable images/graphs. Testing software regarding accessing and processing numeric data and finally 
    alleviated merge conflicts on a large data-base of files. 
    
Both team members contributed to ALL of the above tasks, however the ultimate responsibility of successful implementation was given to the team memberas as they are
